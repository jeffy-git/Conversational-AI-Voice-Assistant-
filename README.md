requirements.txt (you can drop straight into your project):

speechrecognition==3.10.0
pyttsx3==2.90
pyaudio==0.2.14
ollama==0.1.6

‚ö° Notes on why these are needed:

speechrecognition ‚Üí handles converting your voice to text.

pyttsx3 ‚Üí text-to-speech engine for responses.

pyaudio ‚Üí required backend for microphone input (speechrecognition depends on it).

ollama ‚Üí Python client to interact with the Ollama LLM running locally.

üîß Installation:
pip install -r requirements.txt


‚ö†Ô∏è One catch: PyAudio can sometimes be tricky to install on Windows. If you hit issues, you may need to download the .whl file from PyAudio wheels
 and install with:
 
pip install PyAudio-0.2.14-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
